# LiveKit Meet Classroom Feature Roadmap

## 🎯 PHASE 3 COMPLETED - READY FOR PHASE 4

### Quick Start for Next Developer/Session

**Current Status**: Phases 1-3 complete, ready to implement Phase 4 - Custom Video Conference Component

**Last Completed**: Phase 3 - Classroom Client Implementation with:
- Role-based UI layouts (teacher spotlight + student grid)
- Chat integration with proper LiveKit patterns
- Translation feature for students (toggleable sidebar)
- Role-based control bar (teachers get full controls, students get chat/leave only)
- Visual role indicators and badges

**Phase 4 Goal**: Create enhanced video conference component with education-specific features:
- Advanced layout modes (speaker view, grid view, focus mode)
- Improved screen share handling
- Better participant management UI
- Performance optimizations for large classes

**Key Files to Enhance**:
1. Create `/app/rooms/[roomName]/ClassroomVideoConference.tsx` - Enhanced conference component
2. Refactor existing ClassroomClientImpl.tsx to use new component

**Architecture Decision**: Build specialized video conference component optimized for education use cases.

2. **Scale Testing**: Need to test with 50+ participants
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Some features require modern browsers
4. **Mobile Experience**: Limited screen space for controls

### Product

1. **Role Authentication**: Need proper auth system
2. **Moderation Tools**: Handling disruptive participants
3. **Recording Storage**: Large files for long classes
4. **Network Quality**: Students may have poor connections

### Solutions Under Consideration

- WebSocket for real-time permission updates
- CDN for global distribution
- Adaptive bitrate for poor connections
- Progressive web app for mobile
- OAuth integration for authentication
