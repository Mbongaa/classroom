2. **Scale Testing**: Need to test with 50+ participants
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Some features require modern browsers
4. **Mobile Experience**: Limited screen space for controls

### Product

1. **Role Authentication**: Need proper auth system
2. **Moderation Tools**: Handling disruptive participants
3. **Recording Storage**: Large files for long classes
4. **Network Quality**: Students may have poor connections

### Solutions Under Consideration

- WebSocket for real-time permission updates
- CDN for global distribution
- Adaptive bitrate for poor connections
- Progressive web app for mobile
- OAuth integration for authentication
