# LiveKit Meet Classroom Implementation Status

## 📊 Overall Progress: 42% Complete (5 of 11 Phases)

This document summarizes the current state of the LiveKit Meet Classroom implementation for continuation in a new chat session.

## 🎯 Project Overview

A Next.js 15 application with LiveKit integration for video conferencing, featuring a special classroom mode with role-based permissions (Teacher/Student). The system allows teachers to control which students can speak, with proper LiveKit token-based permission management.

## ✅ Completed Features (Phases 1-5)

### Phase 1: Role-Based Access System
- ✅ Teacher vs Student role differentiation
- ✅ Token generation with appropriate permissions
- ✅ Role badges and UI indicators
- ✅ Smart PreJoin defaults (students join with media off)

### Phase 2: Teacher Shares Link Flow
- ✅ URL shortcuts: `/t/[roomName]` for teachers, `/s/[roomName]` for students
- ✅ Copy Student Link button for teachers
- ✅ Optional PIN protection (4-6 digits)
- ✅ Enhanced student welcome experience

### Phase 3: Custom Classroom UI
- ✅ Teacher spotlight (large video area)
- ✅ Student grid at bottom
- ✅ Translation sidebar for students (placeholder)
- ✅ Resizable chat sidebar
- ✅ Unified dark theme

### Phase 4: UI Polish & Bug Fixes
- ✅ Fixed audio routing and duplicate sections
- ✅ Speaking indicators for active participants
- ✅ Resizable sidebars with drag handles
- ✅ LiveKit-compliant implementations

### Phase 5: Teacher Permission Controls (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Dynamic permission updates using LiveKit's updateParticipant API
- ✅ No page reload required - permissions update in real-time
- ✅ Portal-based dropdown menu (avoids UI overflow issues)
- ✅ Native LiveKit speaking indicators (blue) instead of custom green
- ✅ Grant/Revoke speaking permissions working perfectly
- ✅ Student notification system with Accept/Decline
- ✅ Conditional control bar (mic/camera only for speakers)
- ✅ Remove participant API fully integrated
- ✅ Agent/bot filtering from UI
- ✅ Fixed 500 error with correct updateParticipant signature

## 🏗️ Current Architecture

### Permission System Flow (UPDATED - LiveKit Pattern)
```
1. Student joins with canPublish: false
   ↓
2. No mic/camera controls visible
   ↓
3. Teacher grants permission via dropdown
   ↓
4. API calls updateParticipant with new permissions
   ↓
5. LiveKit updates permissions server-side
   ↓
6. ParticipantPermissionsChanged event fired
   ↓
7. Student receives notification
   ↓
8. Student accepts - camera/mic enabled immediately
   (No reconnection or page reload required!)
```

### Key Technical Decisions
- **LiveKit updateParticipant API**: Dynamic permission updates without token regeneration
- **No Reconnection Required**: Permissions update in real-time via server-side API
- **Portal Dropdown**: React Portal renders dropdown outside container constraints
- **Native Speaking Indicators**: Using LiveKit's built-in blue indicators
- **UI State**: Controls visibility based on participant permissions object
- **Agent Filtering**: Multiple checks to hide LiveKit bots from UI

## 📁 Critical Files & Their Current State

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// /app/api/connection-details/route.ts
- Generates initial tokens
- Students: canPublish: false
- Teachers: canPublish: true, roomAdmin: true

// /app/api/update-student-permission/route.ts
- Uses RoomServiceClient.updateParticipant()
- Updates permissions dynamically (canPublish, canPublishData, etc.)
- Updates participant metadata
- No token generation (following LiveKit pattern)
- Fixed signature: 4 parameters only

// /app/api/remove-participant/route.ts
- Removes students from room
- ✅ Backend complete
- ✅ Frontend fully integrated
```

### UI Components
```typescript
// /app/rooms/[roomName]/ClassroomClientImpl.tsx
- Main classroom UI implementation
- Separates: teacher, speakingStudents, listeningStudents
- Conditional control bar based on canSpeak
- Handles permission notifications
- ⚠️ Speaking students should move to main video area

// /lib/PermissionDropdownPortal.tsx
- Portal-based dropdown (renders at document body)
- Smart positioning to avoid viewport edges
- Grant/Revoke/Remove options all working
- Clean floating UI above all content

// /lib/StudentPermissionNotification.tsx
- Modal for permission changes
- Accept/Decline for grants
- Auto-dismiss for revokes
```

## ✅ All Major Issues Resolved!

### Recently Fixed in Phase 5 Final
1. ✅ **Dynamic Permissions**: Using LiveKit updateParticipant API - no reload needed!
2. ✅ **500 Error Fix**: Corrected updateParticipant method signature (4 params)
3. ✅ **Portal Dropdown**: No more overflow/scrolling issues
4. ✅ **Native Speaking Indicators**: Using LiveKit's blue indicators
5. ✅ **Remove Participant**: Fully integrated and working

### Latest Implementation (FINAL)
```typescript
// /app/api/update-student-permission/route.ts
// FIXED: Proper LiveKit pattern
await roomService.updateParticipant(
  roomName,
  studentIdentity,
  metadata, // 3rd param
  permissions // 4th param - no 5th param!
);

// /lib/PermissionDropdownPortal.tsx
// NEW: Portal-based rendering
createPortal(<DropdownMenu />, document.body)
```

   - Text: Student types question, appears as bubble on avatar

2. **User Flow**:
   - Student clicks floating button → Chooses mode
   - Voice: Wait for approval → Get permission → Speak
   - Text: Type question → Submit → Display as bubble

3. **Components to Build**:
   - `StudentRequestButton.tsx` - Floating UI button
   - `RequestModeModal.tsx` - Mode selection
   - `RequestIndicator.tsx` - Avatar overlay
   - `QuestionBubble.tsx` - Text display

## 💡 Key Learnings & Gotchas

### LiveKit Specific
1. **Tokens are immutable** - Cannot change permissions without new token
2. **Agent participants** - LiveKit adds bots that must be filtered from UI
3. **ControlBar behavior** - Reads permissions from token, not app state
4. **ParticipantKind enum** - Multiple formats: 'agent', 'AGENT', ParticipantKind.Agent

### React/Next.js Specific
1. **useEffect timing** - Media must be disabled immediately after connection
2. **Participant metadata** - JSON parse required, may be undefined
3. **Track references** - Must check isTrackReference before use
4. **Room context** - Must be within RoomContext.Provider

## 📝 Next Steps for New Chat Session

### Phase 6: Student Request System
1. **Implement Raise Hand Feature**
   - Create raise hand button for students
   - Queue management system
   - Teacher notifications

2. **Data Channel Communication**
   - Use LiveKit data channels for requests
   - Real-time request updates
   - Auto-lower hand after speaking

3. **UI Components**
   - Student request button with animation
   - Teacher notification panel
   - Request queue display

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Student joins without controls
- [ ] Teacher grants permission
- [ ] Student receives notification
- [ ] Student reconnects with controls
- [ ] Student can enable camera/mic
- [ ] Teacher revokes permission
- [ ] Student loses media access
- [ ] Remove student from room
