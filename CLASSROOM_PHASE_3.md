# CLASSROOM PHASE 3: Classroom Client UI

## Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## Implementation Summary

Phase 3 successfully implemented a dedicated classroom UI with role-based experiences for teachers and students. The implementation provides distinct interfaces optimized for educational use cases.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Role-Based Layout System
- **Teacher View**: Large video/screen share display with student grid below
- **Student View**: Focus on teacher content with peer visibility in grid
- **Dynamic Layout**: Responsive design adapting to different screen sizes

### 2. Chat Integration Fix
- Properly integrated LiveKit's native chat component using `useLayoutContext`
- Chat sidebar toggles correctly from control bar button
- Fixed initial visibility issue where chat was showing by default
- Maintains consistent behavior with standard LiveKit rooms

### 3. Role-Based Control Bar
- **Teachers**: Full controls (mic, camera, screen share, chat, leave)
- **Students**: Limited controls (chat and leave only)
- Media controls properly hidden from students to prevent confusion
- Controls defined dynamically based on `isTeacher` role

### 4. Translation Feature for Students
- **Floating Toggle Button**:
  - Positioned at bottom-left corner (20px from edges)
  - Gradient purple background with hover effects
  - 56px circular button with üåê emoji
  - Visible only to students
- **Translation Sidebar**:
  - Slides in from left side (mirroring chat from right)
  - 320px width matching chat sidebar
  - Header with title and close button
  - Placeholder content indicating future translation features
  - Smooth animations and transitions

### 5. Visual Role Indicators
- Role badges on video tiles (üë®‚Äçüè´ Teacher, üë®‚Äçüéì Student)
- Different badge colors (green for teacher, blue for students)
- Clear participant names with fallback displays
- No-video placeholders with appropriate icons

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### `/app/rooms/[roomName]/ClassroomClientImpl.tsx`
- Main classroom UI component with role-based rendering
- Integrated `useLayoutContext` for proper chat state management
- Added translation sidebar state and toggle logic
- Implemented teacher/student separation logic
- Role badges and participant organization

#### `/app/rooms/[roomName]/ClassroomClient.module.css`
- Complete styling system for classroom layout
- Flexbox-based responsive design
- Translation sidebar and button styles
- Mobile-responsive breakpoints
- Smooth animations for UI transitions

### Key Code Patterns

1. **Role Detection**:
```typescript
const isTeacher = userRole === 'teacher';
const metadata = participant.metadata ? JSON.parse(participant.metadata) : {};
const participantRole = metadata.role || 'student';
```

2. **Layout Context Integration**:
```typescript
const { widget } = useLayoutContext();
// Chat visibility controlled by widget.state?.showChat
```

3. **Conditional UI Rendering**:
```typescript
controls={{
  microphone: isTeacher,
  camera: isTeacher,
  chat: true,
  screenShare: isTeacher,
  leave: true
}}
```

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Chat Toggle Responsiveness
- **Problem**: Chat was initially visible and toggle wasn't working
- **Solution**: Used `useLayoutContext` and `widget.state?.showChat` instead of CSS selectors
- **Result**: Proper integration with LiveKit's native chat system

### 2. Student Media Controls
- **Problem**: Students were seeing mic/camera/screenshare buttons
- **Solution**: Made ControlBar controls conditional based on `isTeacher` flag
- **Result**: Students only see chat and leave buttons

### 3. Translation Button Visibility
- **Problem**: Button wasn't visible for students initially
- **Root Cause**: Race condition with `isClassroom` state initialization and Next.js caching
- **Solution**: Server restart and cache clearing, plus proper component rendering logic
- **Result**: Button now consistently visible for students

### 4. React Server Components Error
- **Problem**: Bundler error "Could not find the module PageClientImpl.tsx#PageClientImpl"
- **Solution**: Cleared Next.js cache and restarted development server
- **Result**: Clean compilation and proper module resolution

## UI/UX Improvements

1. **Intuitive Role Separation**: Clear visual distinction between teacher and student interfaces
2. **Responsive Design**: Proper scaling for mobile and desktop views
3. **Consistent Interactions**: Chat and translation use similar sidebar patterns
4. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support
5. **Visual Feedback**: Hover states, pressed states, smooth transitions

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Teacher can see and use all media controls
- [x] Students cannot see or access media controls
- [x] Chat toggle works for both roles
- [x] Translation button visible only to students
- [x] Translation sidebar toggles properly
- [x] Role badges display correctly
- [x] Responsive design works on mobile
- [x] No console errors or warnings
- [x] Proper cleanup on component unmount

## Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 3)

1. **Translation Features**:
   - Live transcription integration
   - Multi-language support
   - Real-time translation API integration
   - Language selection dropdown

2. **Classroom Management**:
   - Hand raising system
   - Participant muting by teacher
   - Breakout rooms
   - Attendance tracking

3. **Interactive Tools**:
   - Whiteboard/annotation tools
   - Polls and quizzes
   - Screen sharing permissions
   - File sharing

## Migration Notes

When upgrading from Phase 2 to Phase 3:
1. Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
2. Restart development server
3. Test both teacher and student flows
4. Verify role-based permissions are working
5. Check responsive design on different devices

## Dependencies

No new dependencies were added. Phase 3 uses existing LiveKit components:
- `@livekit/components-react` for UI components
- `livekit-client` for WebRTC functionality
- Native React hooks for state management

## Performance Considerations

- Minimal re-renders through proper React.memo usage
- Efficient state updates with functional setState
- CSS-based animations for smooth transitions
- Lazy loading of translation feature (only for students)
- Optimized role checking with useMemo hooks
