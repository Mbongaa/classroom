# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ðŸŽ¯ DEFAULT PERSONA: LiveKit Architect

**CRITICAL**: This is a LiveKit real-time communication project. All operations in this repository MUST use the **`--persona-livekit-architect`** persona by default.

The LiveKit Architect persona is required because:
- LiveKit uses event-driven, state-machine architecture (not traditional web patterns)
- Incorrect patterns from generalist personas have caused system breakages
- Real-time communication requires specialized WebRTC and LiveKit expertise

**Auto-invoke**: `--persona-livekit-architect` for ALL operations in this repository

Refer to `.claude/agent-routing.md` for detailed routing rules.

## Common Development Commands

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev         # Start development server on http://localhost:3000
pnpm build       # Build for production
pnpm start       # Start production server
```

### Code Quality

```bash
pnpm lint        # Run ESLint
pnpm lint:fix    # Fix ESLint issues automatically
pnpm format:check    # Check code formatting with Prettier
pnpm format:write    # Auto-format code with Prettier
pnpm test        # Run tests with Vitest
```

### Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Set required LiveKit credentials:
   - `LIVEKIT_API_KEY` - From LiveKit Cloud Dashboard
   - `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` - From LiveKit Cloud Dashboard
   - `LIVEKIT_URL` - WebSocket URL (e.g., `wss://my-project.livekit.cloud`)

## Architecture Overview

### Core Application Structure

This is a Next.js 15 application using React 18 with LiveKit Components for video conferencing.

### Key Routes & Components

**Landing Page** (`/app/page.tsx`)

- Two tabs: Demo mode (free tier) and Custom connection (own LiveKit server)
- Generates room IDs and handles E2EE passphrase encoding
- Routes to either `/rooms/[roomName]` or `/custom/`

**Room Implementation** (`/app/rooms/[roomName]/`)

- `page.tsx`: Server component handling params and search params
- `PageClientImpl.tsx`: Main client component with PreJoin and video conference logic
- Supports classroom mode via URL params (`?classroom=true&role=teacher|student`)
- Smart defaults: Students join with mic/camera off, teachers with media on

**Custom Connection** (`/app/custom/`)

- For connecting with custom LiveKit servers using user-provided tokens
- Similar structure to rooms but bypasses internal token generation

### Token Generation & Permissions

**API Endpoint** (`/app/api/connection-details/route.ts`)

- Generates LiveKit JWT tokens with role-based permissions
- Three permission models:
  1. **Regular Room**: Full permissions for all participants
  2. **Teacher**: Full permissions + room admin + recording rights
  3. **Student**: Listen-only (no publish) but can use chat

Token structure includes metadata with role information for client-side UI adaptation.

### Classroom Feature Implementation

The codebase includes classroom features for educational use (Phases 1-6 complete, 55% of roadmap):

**Phase 1 - Role-Based Access**:
- Token generation with teacher/student permissions
- Smart PreJoin defaults (students join with mic/camera off)
- Role badges and graceful error handling

**Phase 2 - Teacher-Shares-Link Flow**:
- URL shortcuts: `/s/[roomName]` for students, `/t/[roomName]` for teachers
- Copy Student Link button for teachers (floating top-right in conference)
- Optional PIN protection (4-6 digits)
- Enhanced student welcome experience

**Phase 3 - Classroom Client UI**:
- Custom classroom layout with teacher spotlight and student grid
- Role-based UI with visual badges
- Translation sidebar for students
- Chat integration with LiveKit patterns

**Phase 4 - UI Enhancements & Bug Fixes**:
- Fixed audio routing and duplicate sections
- Speaking indicator for teacher
- Resizable sidebars (translation and chat)
- Unified dark theme
- LiveKit-compliant implementations

**Phase 5 - Teacher Permission Controls**:
- LiveKit updateParticipant API for dynamic permissions (best practice)
- Real-time permission updates without reconnection
- Portal-based dropdown UI (floating above all content)
- Grant/Revoke speaking permissions
- Remove participant functionality
- No token regeneration needed (server-side updates)

**Phase 6 - Student Request System (COMPLETED)**:
- Dual-mode request system (voice ðŸŽ¤ or text ðŸ’¬)
- Floating raise hand button for students
- Request mode selection modal
- Visual indicators on student avatars (âœ‹ icon)
- Question bubbles for text display
- Teacher queue panel for request management
- Integration with Phase 5 permission system
- Real-time updates via LiveKit Data Channels

**Usage**:
- Teachers: Start classroom â†’ optionally set PIN â†’ share generated link
- Students: Click teacher's link â†’ enter name â†’ join as listener

**Testing**: Test utilities at `/test-classroom` with role selection UI

See `CLASSROOM_PHASE_1.md` through `CLASSROOM_PHASE_6_COMPLETED.md` for implementation details.
See `CLASSROOM_ROADMAP.md` for next phases (Phase 8: Interactive Learning Tools ready to start).

**Important Notes**:
- Translation sidebar exists but is UI-only (no actual translation functionality)
- Phase 7 (Permissions API) removed from roadmap as Phase 5 already implements this
- updateParticipant API confirmed as LiveKit best practice for dynamic permissions

### Translation System

The project includes two translation implementations:
1. **Local Translation Agent** (`translation_agent/`) - Development/testing agent using OpenAI
2. **Bayaan Server Integration** - Production-grade translation with Speechmatics + OpenAI

For details on using the superior Bayaan server for production, see: `BAYAAN_SERVER_INTEGRATION.md`

### LiveKit Integration

**Client SDK** (`livekit-client`): Core WebRTC functionality
**React Components** (`@livekit/components-react`): Pre-built UI components
**Server SDK** (`livekit-server-sdk`): Token generation and API interactions
**Track Processors**: Krisp noise filter support when using LiveKit Cloud

### Component Library (`/lib/`)

- `SettingsMenu.tsx`: Audio/video device selection
- `RecordingIndicator.tsx`: Shows recording status
- `KeyboardShortcuts.tsx`: Hotkey support
- `client-utils.ts`: Room ID generation, E2EE encoding
- `getLiveKitURL.ts`: Multi-region URL routing

## Development Patterns

### Type Safety

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Custom types in `/lib/types.ts` for video codecs, connection details, classroom roles
- React component props use TypeScript interfaces

### Path Aliases

- Use `@/*` for absolute imports from project root
- Example: `import { generateRoomId } from '@/lib/client-utils'`

### State Management

- React hooks for local state
- URL params for room configuration (region, codec, quality)
- Cookies for participant identity persistence

### Error Handling

- Graceful media permission failures for students
- Try-catch blocks around camera/microphone enabling
- Connection error boundaries in video conference components

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
pnpm test              # Run all tests once
pnpm test --watch      # Watch mode for development
pnpm test [filename]   # Test specific file
```

Test files use `.test.ts` extension and are co-located with source files.

## Performance Optimizations

- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Suspense boundaries for loading states
- Performance optimizer hook (`usePerfomanceOptimiser`) for adaptive quality
- Codec selection support (VP9, H264, AV1)

## Deployment Considerations

- Requires Node.js 18+
- Uses pnpm package manager (v10.9.0)
- Environment variables must be set for LiveKit connection
- Optional S3 configuration for recording storage
- Optional Datadog integration for monitoring
