# ✅ Signup Flow Fixed!

## The Problem We Solved
The server-side Supabase client couldn't access the session immediately after signUp in the same server action, causing RLS policies to fail.

## The Solution
We now use a **service role admin client** that bypasses RLS for the initial organization setup during signup. This is safe because:
- It's only used during the controlled signup flow
- The admin client is never exposed to the frontend
- It only performs the initial setup operations

## What Changed

### 1. Created Admin Client (`lib/supabase/admin.ts`)
- Uses the service role key to bypass RLS
- Only for server-side use
- Restricted to administrative operations

### 2. Updated Signup Flow (`lib/actions/auth.ts`)
Now uses the admin client for:
- Creating the organization
- Updating the profile with organization_id
- Adding the user to organization_members

## Testing Instructions

1. **Ensure you have the service role key** in `.env.local`:
   ```env
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ```
   Get this from Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → Service Role Key

2. **Test the signup**:
   - Start dev server: `pnpm dev`
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/signup
   - Use a NEW email address
   - Fill in all fields
   - Submit

3. **Expected Result**:
   - ✅ User created in auth.users
   - ✅ Profile created with role='admin'
   - ✅ Organization created successfully
   - ✅ Profile updated with organization_id
   - ✅ User added to organization_members
   - ✅ Redirect to organization dashboard

## Why This Works

1. **signUp** creates the user and profile (via trigger)
2. **Admin client** bypasses RLS to create organization
3. **Admin client** updates profile and adds member record
4. User is redirected with their session properly established

The RLS policies remain secure for normal operations - we only bypass them during the controlled signup flow.

## Security Note

The admin client with service role key:
- ✅ Is only used server-side
- ✅ Never exposed to frontend
- ✅ Only used for initial setup
- ✅ Regular operations still use RLS

This is a standard pattern for handling signup flows where the session isn't fully established yet!
