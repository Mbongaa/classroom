## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project: `vmxjczdwyhrierexjoph`
3. Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. Click "New Query"
5. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/20250930_create_auth_schema.sql`
6. Paste into the SQL editor
7. Click "Run" button
8. Wait for success confirmation (should see "Success. No rows returned")

### Step 2: Test the Authentication Flow

1. Start your dev server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/signup

3. Create your first account:
   - Enter your name, email, password
   - Organization name: "My School" (or whatever you want)
   - Organization URL: Will auto-generate (e.g., "my-school")
   - Click "Create Account"

4. You'll be redirected to `/dashboard` after signup

5. Test the dashboard:
   - View your organization stats
   - Click "Profile" to edit your information
   - Click "Create New Classroom" to start using LiveKit rooms

### Step 3: Verify Database

1. Go back to Supabase Dashboard
2. Click "Table Editor"
3. You should see these tables:
   - organizations (should have your org)
   - profiles (should have your profile)
   - organization_members (should have you as admin)
   - classrooms, classroom_participants, session_recordings, invitations

## 🔒 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

- ✅ Users can only see data in their organization
- ✅ Teachers can only manage their own classrooms
- ✅ Students can only view classrooms they're enrolled in
- ✅ Admins can manage organization members

### Protected Routes

- ✅ `/dashboard/*` requires authentication
- ✅ `/manage-rooms` requires authentication
- ✅ `/profile` requires authentication
- ✅ Automatic redirect to /login if not authenticated

### Role-Based Access

- ✅ Admin: Can manage organization, all permissions
- ✅ Teacher: Can create classrooms, manage own rooms
- ✅ Student: Can join classrooms, limited permissions

## 🎯 How It Works with LiveKit

### Before Authentication (Current System)

```
User → /rooms/demo → LiveKit Token → Join Room
```

### With Authentication (New System)

```
1. User signs up → Creates organization → Becomes admin
2. User logs in → Session created → Dashboard access
3. Teacher creates classroom → Saved in database
4. Student joins classroom → Verified in database → Logged as participant
5. LiveKit token generated → Role from database → Correct permissions
```

### LiveKit Token Generation Flow

**File**: `app/api/connection-details/route.ts`

1. API receives request for LiveKit token
2. Checks if user is authenticated (Supabase)
3. If authenticated:
   - Gets user's role from database
   - Checks if classroom exists in their org
   - Logs participation for analytics
   - Uses database role for token permissions
4. If not authenticated:
   - Uses role from query param (backward compatible)
   - Still works for guest access

## 📊 Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables

**organizations** - Multi-tenant companies/schools

- Tracks each school/organization
- Subscription tier (free, pro, enterprise)

**profiles** - Extended user data (1:1 with auth.users)

- Links to Supabase auth.users
- Stores full name, avatar, role
- Links to organization

**organization_members** - User-org relationships

- Tracks who belongs to which org
- Stores role per organization

**classrooms** - LiveKit room metadata

- Room code (e.g., "MATH101")
- Teacher who created it
- Settings (language, recording, etc.)

**classroom_participants** - Enrollment tracking

- Who's in what classroom
- Last attended timestamp

**session_recordings** - For Phase 3 (recording integration)

- Ready for when you implement recording
- Links to classrooms and storage

**invitations** - Organization invites

- Email-based invites
- Expiration dates

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Test these scenarios:

### Authentication Flow

- [ ] Sign up with new account
- [ ] Verify email/password validation
- [ ] Sign out
- [ ] Sign in again
- [ ] Try accessing /dashboard without login (should redirect)
- [ ] Try accessing /login when logged in (should redirect to dashboard)

### Dashboard

- [ ] View organization stats
- [ ] Check that counts are accurate
- [ ] Click through navigation links

### Profile

- [ ] Update full name
- [ ] Update avatar URL
- [ ] Verify changes saved

### LiveKit Integration

- [ ] Create a classroom with authenticated user
- [ ] Join classroom (should log participation)
- [ ] Verify token has correct role
- [ ] Check database for participation record

## 🔧 Optional Enhancements

### Enable Required Authentication for Classrooms

**File**: `app/api/connection-details/route.ts`

Uncomment lines 34-36 to require authentication for classroom sessions:

```typescript
if (isClassroom && !user) {
  return new NextResponse('Authentication required for classroom sessions', { status: 401 });
}
```

### Add Google OAuth

1. Enable Google provider in Supabase Dashboard
2. Add OAuth button functionality to login/signup forms
3. Already styled in the UI!

### Add Classroom Management Pages

Create these pages:

- `/dashboard/classrooms` - List all classrooms
- `/dashboard/classrooms/create` - Create new classroom
- `/dashboard/classrooms/[id]` - Manage specific classroom

### Add Recording Management

When ready for Phase 3:

- `/dashboard/recordings` - List all recordings
- `/dashboard/recordings/[id]` - View specific recording
- Connect to S3 storage

## 🎓 Next Steps

### Phase 3: Recording Integration

Now that auth is complete, you can:

1. Set up S3 storage for recordings
2. Configure LiveKit egress
3. Save recording metadata to `session_recordings` table
4. Build recording management UI

### Additional Features

- Member invitation system
- Classroom analytics
- Attendance tracking
- Role management UI
- Organization settings page

# LiveKit (Already configured)
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your-key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your-secret
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-project.livekit.cloud
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "relation does not exist" error

- Run the SQL migration in Supabase SQL Editor

### Can't sign up

- Check Supabase email confirmation settings
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is correct

### Dashboard shows 0 classrooms

- Normal on first install
- Create classrooms through /manage-rooms

### TypeScript errors

- Run `pnpm install` to ensure all deps installed
- Restart TypeScript server in your editor
