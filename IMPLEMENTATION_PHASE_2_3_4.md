# Classroom Feature Implementation - Phases 2, 3, and 4

## 📊 Implementation Summary

This document outlines the completed implementation of Phases 2, 3, and 4 of the LiveKit Meet Classroom feature.

### ✅ Phase 2: Classroom Entry Page (COMPLETED)

Created a dedicated `/classroom/[roomName]` route with role selection UI.

#### Files Created:

- `/app/classroom/[roomName]/page.tsx` - Server component for routing
- `/app/classroom/[roomName]/ClassroomPreJoin.tsx` - Enhanced PreJoin with role selection

#### Key Features:

- **Visual Role Selection**: Beautiful card-based UI for choosing Teacher or Student role
- **Role-Specific Instructions**: Clear communication about permissions for each role
- **Smart Defaults**: Students join with camera/mic disabled, teachers with media enabled
- **Graceful Transitions**: Smooth flow from role selection to PreJoin to conference

---

### ✅ Phase 3: Classroom Client Implementation (COMPLETED)

Built the main client component with role-based logic and connection handling.

#### Files Created:

- `/app/classroom/[roomName]/ClassroomClientImpl.tsx` - Main client orchestration

#### Key Features:

- **Role State Management**: Maintains selected role throughout the session
- **Connection Setup**: Passes role information to API for appropriate token generation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error management with user-friendly messages
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows existing patterns from PageClientImpl

---

### ✅ Phase 4: Custom Video Conference Component (COMPLETED)

Implemented a classroom-optimized video conference layout using LiveKit's FocusLayoutContainer.

#### Files Created:

- `/app/classroom/[roomName]/ClassroomVideoConference.tsx` - Custom conference component

#### Key Features:

- **FocusLayoutContainer Integration**: Uses LiveKit's built-in focus layout for teacher spotlight
- **Dynamic Layout Switching**: Automatically detects teacher and applies focus layout
- **Screen Share Priority**: Teacher's screen share takes precedence over camera
- **Student Grid View**: Students appear in carousel layout below teacher
- **Role-Based Controls**: Teachers get full control bar, students get chat only
- **Fallback Layout**: Gracefully falls back to standard VideoConference when no teacher

## 🎨 Implementation Details

### Layout Design

The implementation uses LiveKit's `FocusLayoutContainer` component to create a teacher-focused layout:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│    Teacher Video/Screen Share    │
│         (Large Focus Area)        │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Student 1 | Student 2 | Student 3│
│    (Carousel/Grid Layout)        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Role Detection

The system detects teacher role by:

1. Checking local participant metadata
2. Scanning remote participants for teacher role
3. Verifying teacher has active video/screen share

### Control Permissions

- **Teachers**: Full control bar (camera, mic, screen share, chat, settings)
- **Students**: Limited controls (chat only by default)

---

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Accessing the Classroom

1. Navigate to `/classroom/[roomName]` (e.g., `/classroom/math-101`)
2. Select your role (Teacher or Student)
3. Enter your name in the PreJoin screen
4. Join the classroom

### For Teachers

- You'll have full control over your camera, microphone, and screen sharing
- Your video will be the main focus for all students
- You can manage the room and start recordings

### For Students

- You'll join in listen-only mode by default
- Your camera and microphone will be disabled initially
- You can use chat to ask questions
- You'll see the teacher as the main focus with other students in a grid

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture

```
ClassroomClientImpl (Main Orchestrator)
    ├── ClassroomPreJoin (Role Selection & PreJoin)
    └── ClassroomVideoConference (Conference View)
            ├── FocusLayoutContainer (Teacher Focus)
            ├── CarouselLayout (Student Grid)
            └── ControlBar (Role-Based Controls)
```

### LiveKit Components Used

- `FocusLayoutContainer` - Main layout container for focus view
- `FocusLayout` - Teacher video focus area
- `CarouselLayout` - Student participant grid
- `ParticipantTile` - Individual participant video tiles
- `VideoConference` - Fallback when no focus needed
- `ControlBar` - Bottom control bar with role-based permissions

### No Modifications to LiveKit

The implementation follows a key principle: **No modifications to LiveKit components**. All functionality is achieved through:

- Composition of existing LiveKit components
- Configuration of component props
- Role-based conditional rendering
- Smart layout selection based on participant metadata

---

## 🎯 Benefits of This Approach

1. **Maintains LiveKit Integrity**: No core components were modified, ensuring compatibility with future updates
2. **Elegant Simplicity**: Uses LiveKit's built-in patterns and components
3. **Performance Optimized**: Leverages LiveKit's optimized focus layout
4. **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to standard conference when needed
6. **Easy Maintenance**: Clear separation of concerns and minimal custom code

---

## 📊 Testing the Implementation

### Quick Test

1. Start the development server: `pnpm dev`
2. Open two browser windows
3. In Window 1: Go to `/classroom/test-room` and join as Teacher
4. In Window 2: Go to `/classroom/test-room` and join as Student
5. Observe the focus layout with teacher as main video

### Expected Behavior

- **Teacher View**: Standard conference view with full controls
- **Student View**: Teacher in focus, limited controls, other students in grid
- **Dynamic Updates**: Layout updates when teacher enables/disables video
- **Screen Share**: Teacher's screen share takes priority in focus area

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Phase 5+)

While Phases 2-4 are complete, future phases can build on this foundation:

- **Phase 5**: Teacher Controls Component (mute all, grant speaking)
- **Phase 6**: Student Request Button (raise hand functionality)
- **Phase 7**: Dynamic Permissions API (real-time permission updates)
- **Phase 8+**: Interactive tools, analytics, LMS integration

---

## 📝 Notes

- The implementation maintains full backward compatibility with existing rooms
- Regular rooms at `/rooms/[roomName]` continue to work unchanged
- The classroom feature is opt-in via the `/classroom/` route
- All LiveKit WebRTC functionality remains intact
- The focus layout provides optimal bandwidth usage for classroom scenarios
